General :

	- Update iagno and gnect to match gataxx
        - Move more common code into the libgames-support library.
        - Make as much as possible scalable so we can have full-screen
          modes (bug 80204).
        - Seriously look at a11y for actually playing the games.
        - Make games playable by keyboard (bug 126284).
	- Update debian files to be reasonable
        - Make session management work.
        - Make the build system cleaner.
	- Network multiplayer for Ataxx, Mines and Four-in-a-row.
	- Support for GGZ Gaming Zone - http://www.ggzgamingzone.org/

AisleRiot:
	- Freecell hint threading (bug 134798)
        - Better klondike hint (bug 85712)
        - Scheme clean-ups (see bug 51016 for suggestions)
        - Descriptions of games in Select dialog (bug 110730)
        - Find out what's wrong with block-ten.
        - Final missing features from stand-alone freecell (bug 124522).
        - Find the root cause of bug 121762.
	- Merge card.c into draw.c.

Blackjack:
        - Eliminate the splash screen (and hopefully any recalculation).
        - Multiplayer (bug 129639)
        - Training mode (bug 129638)
        - Rules dialog clean-up (bug 124613)

Gataxx:
        - Share a front-end with Iagno.

Gnect:
        - Graphics (could we share some with iagno/gataxx)
        - Sound improvements

Gnibbles:
	- Have another look at the preferences: some are disabled during
	  game play, others are enabled, but restart the game. Be consistent.
	- AI worms.

Gnobots2:
        - Clean up the sounds (bug 152107).
	- Icon theme for custom icons ?
        - UI review (bug 132387).

Gnometris:
	- Make preferences changeable mid-game. The old drawing problems should
          be gone, but we should check for other things before re-enabling it.
        - Drag and drop backgrounds:
	  - Accepts gradients.
	  - Tile tileable backgrounds rather than scaling them.

Gnomine:
        - Figure out bug 119043. Was it solved with 103125 ? I don't think so.
        - Try and fix the colour issue (part of bug 112571, the bit where
          I misunderstand).
	- Make drawing more efficient, cache the blended pixbufs on
	  the server.
	- Fix up the hint_used signal so that all states get returned this 
	  way (or something else that doesn't look completely awful like the 
	  current system).

Gnotski:
        - Record completed puzzles (bug 111543)

Gtali:
        - Remove that space from gtali.schemas.in once intltool has
          had a few more releases (and upgrade the required version to 0.31
          or whatever it becomes.
	- Select all/select none, almost like (bug 137104).

Iagno:
	- Add an "I'm thinking" message, especially for level 3 AI.
        - Merge with Gataxx (see above)
        - High contrast theme ? Other a11y stuff.
        - See if the code causing problems in bug 79180 can't be 
          glib-ised to make the portability problem glibs.
        - Make defaults consistent with gataxx.
        - Make selecting side in a network game better (bug 119195).
        - Make moves more obvious (bug 118996)

Mahjongg:
        - Fix up the tile search function for speed.
        - Make resizing a bit snappier.
        - Level editor and external level files (the later has been
	  partly done already).

libgames-support:
	- Widgets other than the combo box for the GamesFileList.
	- GamesFileList standard directory option for paths.
	- Make a shared library. Rename to libgnome-games
