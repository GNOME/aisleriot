  <para>
    Play begins by dealing four cards to the Reserve.  If possible, play
    cards on to the Foundation from the Reserve.  Continue this process
    until no cards are left in stock and no more moves on to Foundation
    can be made.  A similar game that is a bit easier is Scuffle.

  <para>
    Do you believe in Luck?  Although this game takes more skill to play
    than Clock, the skill involved entails paying attention.  A great
    game for brainless play.
