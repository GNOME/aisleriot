    Each Tableau pile must be filled before any deal.  Clicking on the
    Stock will deal a card on to every Tableau pile except for the last
    deal which places one card on each of the first three piles.

    A build of all thirteen cards in a suit may be moved on to a
    Foundation pile.  Cards in the Foundation are no longer in play.
