	<para>
		Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color.  Groups of
		cards can be moved if there are enough Reserve piles free to allow the
		move if the cards were moved singly.  An empty pile in the Tableau can
		be filled with any card or group of cards.
	</para>
	<para>
		Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in Foundations
		are not in play.  Double clicking on a card will move it to the
		appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
	</para>
	<para>
		Cards in Reserve piles can be played back on to Tableau or on to the
		Foundation.
