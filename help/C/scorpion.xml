		moved regardless of sequence.  An empty pile in the Tableau can be
		filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
	</para>
	<para>
		At any point, clicking on the Stock will deal the last three cards, one
		each on the first three piles.

		extra points are awarded.  Reaching a card that was face down gives
		three points.
