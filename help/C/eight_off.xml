    The Tableau is built down by suit.  Only the top card or build of
    cards can be moved.  A build of cards can only be moved if the
    number of cards in the build is equal or less than one more than the
    number of Reserve slots free.  Empty spaces in the Tableau can only
    be filled with a King or a build starting with a King.
  </para>

    Foundations are built up by suit from Ace to King.

    Any top card in the Tableau can be placed in an empty Reserve slot.
    These cards are available for play back into the Tableau or on to a
    Foundation pile.
