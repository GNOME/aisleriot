	<para>
		Cards in the Tableau are built down by suit.  Groups of cards can be
		moved regardless of sequence.  Groups of cards in sequence can be moved
		into an appropriate and receptive Foundation pile.  An empty pile in the
		Tableau can be filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the
		bottom.
	</para>
	<para>
		Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in Foundations
		are no longer in play.

        <sect2><title>Scoring</title>

	<para>
		When game is dealt, any sequence of cards going down in suit is
		awarded one point per card.  Every move within the Tableau will award
		a point for every card in the newly created sequence.  A point is also
		rewarded for every card placed on to the Foundation.
	</para>

		Maximum possible score:  412

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

	<para>
		The more you can hold on to, the more you will have.  Try to keep cards
		out of Foundations as long as possible.  The larger the sequences, the
		more points are made.
