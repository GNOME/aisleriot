    Move all cards to the Foundation piles.

  <para>
    The first item of play is to select an available card for the first
    Foundation.  Once selected, all other Foundations must also start
    with this value.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up by suit, wrapping from King to Ace where
    necessary.  Once a card is placed on a Foundation pile, it is out of
    play.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color.  Whole
    piles of cards can be moved on to another Tableau pile.  Empty slots
    in the Tableau can be filled by any available card in the Reserves
    or, if all the Reserves are empty, from the Waste.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards are flipped singly from Stock to Waste.  There is one redeal.
  </para>

    Maximum possible score:  52

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Be careful when selecting your first Foundation pile.  Try to get
    the cards out of the Reserves as early as possible.  Sometimes
    keeping cards in play is more important than moving them to the
    Foundation.
