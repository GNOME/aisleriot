	    Seven piles.  Place one card face up on all piles.  Next row 
	    skip the first pile and place cards on all the other piles.  
	    Continue this process skipping one place to the right each row 
	    until there are seven rows with seven cards in the last pile.  
	    Essentially Saratoga is the same as Klondike only the all 
	    cards are face up to begin with.  Being able to see all cards 
	    reduces the element of risk and makes Saratoga slightly easier 
	    than Klondike.  
	    <!-- TODO FIXME link to Klondike Help page -->
	    Tableau can be built down in alternating colors.  Builds of
	    cards can be moved.  Empty piles can only be filled by Kings
	    or group of cards starting with a King.

  <para>
    Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color.  Builds of
    cards can be moved.  An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with
    a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually.  Top
    card in Waste is in play.  When Stock is empty, move all cards in
    Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the
    deck three times.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in
    Foundations are still in play.  Double clicking on a card will move
    it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
  </para>

  <para>
    Three card deals: If checked, the Stock will deal three each time.
    Otherwise, the Stock will deal singly into the Waste.
  </para>
  <para>
    King Only: If checked empty space may be filled with Kings or 
    groups of cards starting with a King only.

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Don't give up the ship!  Try brute force methods when the game seems
    over.  Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the
    Foundation and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards.
