  <para>
    Remove all diamonds to the foundation and have all the other cards
    in suit and sequence with Aces being low in the Tableau.
  </para>

          </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Rules</title>

  <para>
    Cards (other than diamonds) can be built down in sequence regardless
    of suit.  Builds of cards can be moved as a unit.  Empty slots can
    be filled by any card (except for diamonds) or build of cards.
  </para>
  <para>
    Diamonds cannot be moved except to be place on to the Foundation.
    The diamond Foundation must be built up in sequence but can start
    from any number you want.
  </para>

          </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Scoring</title>

  <para>
    Each diamond placed on to the Foundation scores the face value of
    the card, with Ace as one point, Jacks as eleven points, Queens as
    twelve points, and Kings as thirteen points.
  </para>
  <para>
    Each Ace through King in sequence and in suit on the Tableau pile
    scores three points.
  </para>
  <para>
    Maximum possible score:  100
  </para>

          </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Mining for diamonds is hard work.  Keep in mind that not all
    diamonds are worth the same.  Don't forget to clean up after
    yourself and put the other suits in order.
