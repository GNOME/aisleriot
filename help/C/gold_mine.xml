    cards can be moved.  An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with
    any card.

  <para>
    Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste three at a time.  Top
    card in Waste is in play.  When Stock is empty, game over.

  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in
    Foundations are still in play.  Double clicking on a card will move
    it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
