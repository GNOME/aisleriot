    Move all cards to the Foundation piles.

        <sect2><title>Rules</title>

  <para>
    Cards in Tableau are built down in the same suit.  Cards can only
    be moved singly. An empty pile in the Tableau can 
    be filled with any card. As a short cut you can move more than one if
    there are enough empty spaces. Cards can also be moved in groups to the 
    Foundation piles.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards are played singly from the Stock to the waste pile, whose 
    top card is available for play. There are no redeals.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Double clicking
    on a foundation will autoplay cards. Double clicking on a card in 
    the Tableau or waste will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile
    if such a move is possible, or to the tableau if possible.
  </para>

          </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Scoring</title>

  <para>
    Each card in the Foundation scores 5 points.  When a Foundation pile
    is complete (from Ace to King), 60 more points are scored. 
  </para>
  <para>
    Maximum possible score:  1000
  </para>

          </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Refrain from bringing cards to the tableau in order to obtain an empty
    space as soon as possible. Then balance the requirements to maintain
    empty spaces against the need to save low cards from being buried in
    the waste.
