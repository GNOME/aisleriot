  <para>
	Cards in the Tableau are built down in sequence by alternating
	colors building round the corner. Groups of cards can't be moved.
	An empty pile in the Tableau must be filled by the top card in
	Waste or the next card from the Stock. Top cards can be moved to
	the Foundation or other Tableau piles.
  </para>
  <para>
	Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colors from
	the base card. Empty Foundations must be filled with the base card
	that is selected by the user from four random cards as the first
	move. Cards in Foundations are out of play.
  </para>
  <para>
	Top card of the Reserve is in play and can only be moved to
	Foundations.
  </para>
  <para>
	Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually as many
	times as you like unless there is a space in the tableau. If there
	is a space in the tableau then only one card may be flipped from
	the stock to the waste until the tableau is filled or the top card
	of the waste is moved to the foundation or tableau. While the
	stock is locked you can still move cards around on the tableau,
	from the reserve and to the foundation. If the Waste is empty a
	card from the Stock is automatically dealt. Top card in Waste is
	in play. Stock cannot be turned.
  </para>
  <para>
	Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate
	Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
  </para>

	card from a choice of four at the start of the game and one card is
	dealt to each Tableau pile. Stock can be turned once but the game
	is lost if you cannot play each new card after its turned.
