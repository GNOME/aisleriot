  <para>
    Cards can be removed in pairs that have the same value as long as
    the two cards are touching horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  </para>
  <para>
    At any point that there are empty piles in the Tableau, dealing from
    the Stock moves all the cards already in the Tableau from the right
    to left and moving them up a row to the far right if necessary
    making all the empty slots at the end.  The Stock is then dealt on
    to these empty slots.

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Keep an eye out as to how the Tableau will shrink when you deal.
    Sometimes leaving pairs in will allow more pairs to become available
    after a deal.
