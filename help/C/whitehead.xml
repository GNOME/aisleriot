  <para>
    Cards in the Tableau are built down by same color.  Builds of cards
    that are the same suit and in sequence can be moved as a unit.
    Empty Tableau slots can be filled with any card or build of cards.
  </para>
  <para>
    Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually.  Top
    card in Waste is in play.  There are no redeals.
  </para>
  <para>
    Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  Cards in
    Foundations are still in play.  Double clicking on a card will move
    it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
  </para>

          </sect2>

        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Empty Tableau slots are a prized commodity in this game.  Sometimes
    keeping them around until you need them is a very good idea.
