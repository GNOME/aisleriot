		There are two phases to this game.  Alternate between the two phases
		until game is lost or won.  Start with Phase One until Tableau is
		completely filled.  At that point, move to Phase Two.  Please note that
		you cannot begin Phase Two unless the Tableau is completely filled.  At any
		point, you can return to Phase One, but remember that you cannot go back
		to Phase Two unless the tableau is once again filled.  An exception to
		this rule is if the stock and waste are empty.

		It is always safest in the middle.  During Phase One of play, deal in

		play.
