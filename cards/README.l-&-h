The card design is a variant of the "Frankfurt pattern"
(also called "Rhineland pattern") published by the former playing card company
"Vereinigte Stralsunder Spielkartenfabriken" (VSS).
According to card collectors I contacted seeking information it was developed
by the "Frankfurter Spielkartenfabrik Lennhoff & Heuser"
(there are editions with their company sign)
which was taken over by VSS in 1882. 
It was in production by various companies until the 1930s.
