and on my (Vincent Bermel) own scans of a 1979 reprint of the same card deck.

The card design is known as "Jugendstil" / "Art Noveau", was created by
painter Otto Tragy (1866-1928) and first published in the 1890s by the former
german playing card company" Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik Schneider & Co"
which existed from 1893-1897 according to the following resources:
http://www.spielkarten24.de/site08.htm
https://altacarta.com/english/research/AssStammbaum.html

It was in print until the 1930s, a limited reprint was issued in 1979.

Otto Tragy is stated the original designer in some of the resources below as
well as on the box of the 1979 reprint.
