The included JPG-bitmap images (which the above copyright does not apply to)
are based on my retouched scans of a vintage card deck "No. 150 Whist" made by
the former B.Dondorf company. First edition which was printed from 1889 on,
originally sold in the 1890s according to a US tax seal on the box.

The cards are also known as "Mittelalter"/"Middle Ages", the design was in
print until 1933.
