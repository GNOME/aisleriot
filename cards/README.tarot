The included JPG-bitmap images (which the above copyright does not apply to)
are based on my retouched scans of a vintage card deck known as
"Encyclopedic Tarot" or "Bourgeouis Tarot" which was made by the former
C.L. WÃ¼st company. It is an edition which was originally sold from 1890 to 1910
and first printed in the 1860s. After the takeover by the VASS company  in 1927
company these cards were printed until the 1950s in a slightly altered form.

This card design is the predecessor to the design of modern French Tarot cards
which is known as "Tarot Noveau". However the design in print today look
distinctly different as can be seen from the resources linked below.
