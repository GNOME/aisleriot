  <para>
    The Waste can be built up or down from the available cards on the
    Tableau.  Jokers are wild and can be played on any rank as well as
    be played upon by a card of any rank.
  </para>
  <para>
    At any point, a card can be dealt from the Stock to the Waste.

        <sect2><title>Scoring</title>

  <para>
    In rank order you get, 8, 6, 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6, 8 for each
    type of card.. No points are scored for jokers.
  </para>

          </sect2>
        <sect2><title>Strategy</title>

  <para>
    Since you can see all the cards on the Tableau, try to engineer
    `runs', to try and get rid of as many cards up there as possible, as
    you only have a finite supply of cards in Stock.
